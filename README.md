# BlastXtract2

--INTRODUCTION--

BlastXtract2 facilitates early exploration of un-annotated genomic and metagenomic sequences. Various formats of translated searches of multiple sequences against multiple protein databases can be uploaded to a MySQL server accessed by a locally installed BlastXtract2 web-server. There, an intuitive GUI allows straightforward data-mining and enables quick detection of potential frameshifts and poorly sequenced/assembled regions.

Before installing feel free to test a demo version at

--INSTALLATION--

BlastXtract2 is developed using Perl 5.8.0 on the Linux Ubuntu 12.0 operating system. 
To install BlastXtract, make sure you have permission to write to the cgi-enabled directory to create databases in MySQL/PostgreSQL, which should be up and running. Then run the installation program blastXtract2_install.pl 
This script checks that all the perl modules are installed, sets a few installation parameters, creates the MySQL/PostgreSQL database and copies the modified program to the appropriate webserver destination.
 
--IMPORTANT NOTES--

In the Apache configuration file, set TimeOut to at least 600, since large output files can take long time to upload. If installing the DBD::mysql module make sure to also have mysql-server,
mysql-devel, zlib and zlib-devel installed. Also do 'unset LANG' or 'LANG="c"' before compiling the module.

--MODIFICATION OF COG DATABASE--

The original COG database at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/COG/COG can be modified so that COG categories are visible in BLASTx output results and can be colour-coded and summarised in BlastXtract2. To do this, follow instructions in 'how_COGdb_was_created'.
